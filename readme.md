#sleePY

##This project is currently in development and far from finished

SleePY is a tool that monitors server resources and puts the system to sleep when possible. A seperate Wake On Lan script will become available soon.


Currently monitored:
- HDD status (spin up/spun down)
- CPU Load
- Network load (Up- and Download)


ToDo:

-[ ] Actually put to sleep when thresholds are not met
-[ ] Integrate different sleep states (hibernate, suspend, shutdown)
-[ ] Create service for repeating
